# Hands-on workshop: Implementing observability to secure containers and Kubernetes for EKS

Attend this in-depth, hands-on security workshop with Calico and AWS experts to get insights into Kubernetes cluster traffic, workload interactions, and security policy enforcement. The 90-minute interactive lab comes with your own provisioned Calico Cloud environment and a sample application. This workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience for you to:

- View service-to-service communication to assess security risk from external threats
- Analyze and fix security policy gaps within the cluster
- Detect and prevent anomalous behaviors such as attempts to access restricted URLs
- Implement security policies in runtime to mitigate risk based on vulnerabilities found in build time
